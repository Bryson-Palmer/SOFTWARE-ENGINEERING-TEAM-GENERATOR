  This application will create an HTML file that displays a webpage with a nicely formatted team roster, and their respective summaries, based on the information provided by the user in the node CLI. The application will prompt the user for information about the team manager and then information about the team members. The user can input any number of team members, and they may be a mix of engineers and interns.

As a manager
I want to generate a webpage that displays my team's basic info
so that I have quick access to emails and GitHub profiles

## üîç <a id='future-development'></a> Future Development
* I would like to add a `favicaon` to the title tab. 

* I would also like to get this code aligned with OOP practices as much as possible. I think the app.js could build a start function around the first function called creatManager. That way I could create a new start.js, require the module, and call it. It should start the app and be about 5 lines of code.

* I would also like to practice DRY coding as much as I can. I would move the prompt questions into a function to be called for each new employee created. If I could get all the prompts in one function and use a `when` statement to determine which unique question gets asked based on which employee they picked, that would be ideal. 

* I would figure out a way to validate the inputs to make sure they meet the criteria of the question. I could use npm  `joi` or figure out how to do validation checks on the prompts.  

* Lastly, I would also think that adding a delete button would be ideal. 


## üîß <a id='installation'></a> Installation Instructions
* Just clone this repo down to your own local machine and run in node.



## ‚öôÔ∏è <a id='usage'></a> Usage Information
* First, open an integrated terminal from your preferred IDE and path to the app.js file.
* Next, run the comand in your CLI `node app.js`.
* Next, Answer the prompts. Fill out information for the Manager first. After that, you'll be asked if you want to create an Engineer, or an Intern.
* When you're done entering new employees, then select `I'm all done` from the list of options. 
* Lastly, go to your explorer and locate the output folder. Inside you'll find your newly created team.html file. You can open that html file in your browser and see your team roster.
That's it!
